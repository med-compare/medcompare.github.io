									<h2>Summary of results</h2>
                                    <p>talked to one another before this assignment, these results may help us get to know each other and our strengths and weaknesses. Though these results cannot be relied on to tell us about our group members with absolute certainty, they can help us understand the nature and balance of group member we may have never met before. They can also help us know which tasks will be suited for specific members. It may also give us an idea of how each member may act during the project or discussions. For example if a member has a high introversion score they may be less inclined to speak up in discussions even if they have an idea. This knowledge of their score will make it easier for other group members to ensure that this member isn’t pushed into the background of our discussions. So though these scores are not to be relied upon they are a good method of getting to know group members you may have not met before to ensure effective group work.

							<h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>
							<p>TThe ideal jobs in our group are vastly different. Kristen Da Silva’s ideal job is a IT support specialist, this role is to provide support to ensure the consistency and improve system technologies as well as continuing and installing new system technologies. Samantha Clifton’s ideal job is a UX designer, this position ensures that applications are user friendly by conducting tests and so on to find out the users needs in an application. James Eustice’s preferred role is a cyber security specialist, his role entails finding out wether security has been breached and to create a security plan to ensure that the security of the system is tight.</p>

                             <p>The jobs in our group are extremely different to each-other. Kristen and James’s jobs are more technical base, which makes them similar to each other as it includes more systematic and methodical approach to their jobs, whereas Samantha’s job is more on the creative side, and it includes more artistic and social aspect towards her chosen field. There is also a certain creative skill for coding. These fields are extremely different as they don’t overlap each other at all and its unlikely that these fields would every work together, though all these fields are extremely important in the technology industry to keep things running efficiently and effectively. </p>

                            <p>To work in these fields everyone in the group will need to complete a bachelor degree and gain experience in their chosen fields before being considered for these positions.
